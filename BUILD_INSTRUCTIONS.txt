Build instructions for captioner.exe

Prerequisites:
- Windows machine
- Python 3.10+ in the project's virtualenv at .venv (you already have .venv)
- The project root is D:\codebase\cap

Steps (recommended):
1. Open Command Prompt (not PowerShell).
2. cd D:\codebase\cap
3. Run:
   build_exe.bat

Notes and caveats:
- PyInstaller will bundle the Python app and many dependencies into a single executable, but large models (Whisper) are not embedded by default. The first run of the app may need to download or load the model from disk; ensure your environment has enough disk space.
- If your app depends on large native libs (torch, whisper), PyInstaller builds may be large and require additional hidden-imports or hooks; inspect the PyInstaller output if packaging fails and add missing modules to the build_exe.bat --hidden-import list.
- If you prefer to see console output during debugging, remove the `--noconsole` flag in `build_exe.bat`.

Troubleshooting:
- If PyInstaller fails with missing modules, re-run the command adding `--hidden-import <module>` for each missing module reported.
- If the executable crashes at runtime, run the non-`--noconsole` build to see tracebacks.

If you want, I can:
- Create a PyInstaller spec file with more explicit hooks.
- Try to run a build in this workspace (I cannot execute the build in your environment without your permission to run PyInstaller here).
